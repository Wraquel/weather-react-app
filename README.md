Hello!
 
 This app was developed during the shecodes react workshop. To practice the React.js framework we developed a new version of WeatherApp. I rewrote the javascript code for react.js and made a new design for it. I developed the app responsive and with animated icons. 

Languages/Framework: HTML5, CSS3, REACT.js, API.
